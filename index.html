<p id="trash">Hello, my name is Josh.  I am a sophomore and go to Canyon Crest Academy.  My interests include PC gaming, especially League of Legends, music, geological science, and astronomy.  My classes this term include Chemistry, Math, and Computer Science.  Computer Science is my favorite because it's an easier class where I can relax and learn without much stress.  I only have a mom, dad, and sister.</p>
