  <p id="trash"> Synoposis: My favorite movie is Lord of the Rings.  Lord of the Rings is a movie based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, about a creature named a hobbit who gains possession of a ring that has connection to a long-defeated dark lord, and has to destroy it by tossing it into the volcano where it was forged before the dark lord's minions can capture him and use the ring to revive him.  After a long journey with many battles, dangers, friends, Orcs, and Elves, the main character, a hobbit named Frodo, finally makes it to the volcano and drops the ring into the magma, killing off the dark lord for good. </p>

   <p id="trash"> Review: I personally found the movie really suspenseful and enjoyable.  It was action-packed and full of battles.  There were also many unexpected moments, betrayals, ambushes, and deaths of main characters.  In my opinion, this movie possessed all the traits I consider a good film.</p>
